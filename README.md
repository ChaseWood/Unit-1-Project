## Project Description

I like portfolios with darker color themes and want to start with page with just a single background and a title. After that keeping a more minimal approach that will change some things on hover.

[The font and minimalist style of this website is one of my favroites](https://www.marvinschwaibold.com/)

[The muted coloring with large lettering is something that I really like in the design of this website](https://wakawaka.world/)

[This is an accounting website with similar design](https://sealco.ca/)

[This is a simple design for a contact page that I will probably go with something similar.](https://dev.zeroqode.com/contact)

[Though I like the design of the contact form on this page.](https://focuslabllc.com/contact)

[The scrolling transitions on this page are awesome.](https://www.northand.ca/)

[A more contemporary looking website that I think in the end mine will look more like.](https://www.turtleinc.com/about/peter-komierowski)
